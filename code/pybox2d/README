What is it?
-----------

pybox2d is a 2D physics library for your games and simulation. It's based on the
Box2D library, written in C++. It supports several shape types (circle, polygon,
thin line segments), and quite a few joint types (revolute, prismatic, wheel,
etc.).

Getting Started
---------------

For building instructions, see INSTALL or the wiki on the homepage. Once
installed, check out the testbed demos to see what pybox2d can do (located in 
examples/ ). Then read the manual located on the pybox2d wiki, here:

    http://code.google.com/p/pybox2d/wiki/GettingStartedManual

On the wiki, you will also find more useful things of varying quality.
Here's the epydoc documentation:

It's by no means perfect, but it can come in handy.
